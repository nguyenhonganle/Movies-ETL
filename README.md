### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project was to accumulate film information from both wikipedia and kaggle and make a data set that understudies can use to preform there own investigation. To do these, I removed the neccessary information from Wikipedia and Kaggle, utilized python's pandas library to change the information into a working dataframe, and afterward stacked it to PostgreSQL for understudies to utilize it.
